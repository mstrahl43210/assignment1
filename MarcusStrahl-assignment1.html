    <ul>
      <li>I took a summer course in html as a kid.  I barely remember it.</li>
      <li>I took another html course in high school.  We didn't spend as much time on CSS as we probably should have.</li>
      <li>I haven't used html in years, but it is all slowly coming back to me as I get back to work (and see others' examples).</li>
    </ul>
